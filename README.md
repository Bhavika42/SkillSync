"Students and self-learners often feel overwhelmed and directionless while learning tech skills. Without a structured plan, accountability, or peer support, they tend to lose motivation. SkillSync solves this by providing a personalized roadmap, collaborative spaces, and milestone-based micro-projects, making learning structured, social, and rewarding."
